Variables - we use variables to temporarily store data in computers memory.
you can't use reserved keywords to name variables, classes or methods.
first to declare type of variable --> name(identifier) --> = assignment operator  --> value being assigned

primitive types - for storing simple values
Type --- Bytes --- Range
// whole numbers
byte ---   1   ---  [-128,127]
short --   2   ---  [-32k, 32k]
int  ---   4   ---  [-2b, 2billion]
long ---   8   ---  [large numbers]
//decimals
float --   4   ---
double--   8   ---
char ---   2   ---  [A,B,C,..]
boolean--  1   ---   [ TRUE/FALSE]

non-primitive types (reference) - for storing complex objects
 ---- strings , arrays, user defined classes, objects.
 not defined by the programming language but created by the programmer.
 they are called reference variables or object references since they reference a memory
 location which stores the data



in order to use a class from a different packege we need to import it

}
in java functions are referred to as methods. a method is a function that is
part of a class.

class - a class is a container for one or more related functions. classes are used
to organize code. Every java program should have at lest one class that contains the main
function.

classes are defined by a class modifier (private/ public)
the class keyword followed by a proper descriptive name.

public class Main {     <---- when naming classes we use PascalNamingConvention
    public static void main(){ <----- when naming methods we use camelNamingConvention

    }
}
 main method should always be static
